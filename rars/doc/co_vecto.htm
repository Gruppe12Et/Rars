<p>Here is a <b><font color="#008040">description of the model of traction
force and skidding, etc</font></b>.,&nbsp; that is implemented in <b><i><font color="#FF0000">move_car()</font></i></b>
(CARZ.CPP). Note that <b><font color="#0000FF">"P"</font></b> is used here
for a vector, not for power. Also note that we use <b><font color="#0000FF">"F"</font></b>
for a vector here and <b><font color="#0000FF">"f"</font></b> for its magnitude.
In the computer program F was used for the magnitude. (There are no vectors
directly represented in the program.)
<p>We begin by erecting an x-y coordinate system with the positive <b><font color="#0000FF">x
axis</font></b> along the car's velocity vector, and the <b><font color="#0000FF">y
axis</font></b> to the driver's approximate left.
<p>Let:
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">V</font></b></td>

<td>= car's velocity vector, given</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">P</font></b></td>

<td>= car's pointing vector, <b>unit vector</b> in direction car is pointing</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td>(these two are separated by the angle alpha, given)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">W</font></b></td>

<td>= velocity vector of tire bottom surface wrt car</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td><b>= -P * vc&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; ( where <b><font color="#0000FF">"vc"</font></b>
is "velocity commanded", given )</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">L</font></b></td>

<td>= slip vector, velocity of tire bottom wrt track surface.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">F</font></b></td>

<td>= force vector pushing the car; this is in direction opposite to L.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">Ft</font></b></td>

<td>= x-component of F (t for tangential to path)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">Fn</font></b></td>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#0000FF">Lt</font></b></td>

A fundamental vector relation is:
<blockquote><b>L = V + W</b></blockquote>
Which just says that the tire velocity wrt track is the tire velocity
<br>wrt car plus the car velocity wrt track. By simple substitution,
<br>this becomes:
<blockquote><b>L = V - vc * P</b></blockquote>
Since the components of P and V are known, we can write:
<blockquote><b>Lt = v - vc * cosine(alpha);</b>
<br><b>Ln = - vc * sine(alpha)</b></blockquote>
We will use <b>lowercase letters for magnitudes</b> of the vectors,
<br>so the sliding speed of the tire is <b><font color="#0000FF">"l"</font></b>,
and the force is <b><font color="#0000FF">"f"</font></b>. The
<br>force is determined by the friction model. We assume that this
<br>force depends only on l, the slip speed.
<p>f = u(l) where <b><font color="#0000FF">u(l)</font></b> is the friction
function, given. hence:
<blockquote><b>F = - u(l) * L / l</b></blockquote>
Because the F and L vectors are parallel, the components of F are
<br>in the same proportion as the components of L. Hence:
<blockquote><b>Ft = -f * Lt/l</b>
<br><b>Fn = -f * Ln/l</b></blockquote>
The power consumed <b><font color="#0000FF">"pwr"</font></b> is equal to
the component of F parallel
<br>to P, times vc. We compute this by treating the normal and
<br>tangential components of F as two separate forces. The tangential
<br>component of force has the angle alpha wrt the P vector, hence its
<br>contribution to the power is Ft * cosine(alpha). The normal
<br>component, being at right angles to the tangential component, has
<br>contribution Fn * sine(alpha). This gives us:
<blockquote><b>pwr = vc * (Ft * cosine(alpha) + Fn * sine(alpha))</b></blockquote>
That is the procedure currently used to calculate the force vector
<br>and the power consumption. It would be convenient if there was a
<br>practical way to start with power or force as a given, and compute
vc
<br>and the force and slip vectors; unfortunately the only known
<br>solution, due to Matt Timmermans, required solution of a fourth order
<br>polynomial equation. I actually implemented a search procedure to
<br>find vc when power is given, because the solution sent by Matt was
<br>extremely complicated. (So is the search procedure, but it was
<br>already available as a C function, needing relatively minor changes.)
<p>The friction function currently used is of the form:
<blockquote><b>u(l) = FMAX * l / (K + l)</b></blockquote>
where <b><font color="#0000FF">FMAX</font></b> and <b><font color="#0000FF">K</font></b>
are given constants.

<p>Any function that rises steeply from the origin and then levels out
<br>and approaches a maximum might be used. It might be piecewise linear
<br>with only two or three pieces, for example.
<p>In order to have a model that more accurately simulates the real
<br>world, especially paved surfaces, it will be necessary for the
<br>traction force function to depend on more than just the slip speed,
<br>I believe.
