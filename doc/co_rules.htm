<hr>
<font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">

<p>These are the rules and procedures for the races that are hosted by Ralph Scott. These
rules are subject to change at any time, but any such changes will be announced to the
mailing list a reasonable time before they go into effect. Anyone else can also host
races, and they are free to design their own set of rules if they wish. The following are
general rules that apply to all the races. For each race there will be an announcement
that will detail any special requirements for that race.</p>

<p>Entries will be received by e-mail, directed to Ralph Scott &lt;rscott@NetUSA.Net&gt;.
The entries are of course, robot driver functions. They may be in source code, either ANSI
C or C++. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Robots may read a data file. Hence, the entry may consist of two files, the program
file and the data file. The filename for these two files must be the same, except for .dat
extension on the data file. The robot file will have the extension .cpp or .c.</p>

<p>The robot driver function name should be identical to the name string contained in the
program. There should be no more than eight characters in the name, and it must follow the
usual C/C++ naming rules. Therefore, if we have a robot driver named &quot;Charlie&quot;
the name of its function would be Charlie(), and it would be in a file named CHARLIE.CPP
and if it reads a data&nbsp; file the file would be named CHARLIE.DAT. The filename should
not differ from the robot name by&nbsp; anything more than a sequence number at the end,
and the lack of case distinctions.</p>

<p>There are some information requirements for the first few lines of the program file.
The first few lines of every robot driver must have the following:

<ol>
  <li>The filename, your full name, your e-mail address, and your robot's name.</font><font
    FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>What races you want to enter. You can say all, or all oval track,<br>
    or just one date, for example. (Just be clear.)</font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Whether or not you want me to keep the source confidential.</font><font
    FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Tell me if your program needs to read a data file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The filename must change for each new version of your software. The easiest way is just
to append a sequence number, so when BURNS.CPP is changed it becomes BURNS1.CPP, and then
BURNS2.CPP, etc. The robot name and the function name should not change. For example, they
could remain &quot;Burns&quot; and Burns(). Of course you may rename all three if you want
to, and then the filename should be the same as the robot name and function name.</p>

<p>If your robot reads a data file it must be sent at the same time as the robot file. You
must send a new data file when you send a new robot. They should always be sent in pairs
to help keep me from using the wrong data file. It would be best if your data file began
with its own name, and the robot checks it when it reads it, but I won't require that. You
may send a new data file to go with an old robot, but also send a text file giving its
file name, so that I know for certain which robot it goes with.</p>

<p>The software version to be used for each race meet will be announced in advance. It
will generally be the lastest version, or the one just before that one. Needless to say,
the programs must compile and link with that version.</p>

<p>Entries must be received by 1:00 PM, U.S East Coast time, on the day of the
competition. If the net is slow, too bad, so send them as early as possible. It is better
if I receive them several days early, in case there are any problems with compilation,
linking, or execution. (I will inform you A.S.A.P.) All problems must be corrected before
the 1:00 PM deadline. Finally, I won't accept any new entries prior to one week before the
competition. However, if I already have your robot from a previous race you don't have to
submit it again. I will use the information in your robot program to know in which races
it should compete. Only one robot per author will be allowed to compete, so if you have
sent me more than one make it clear which one is the entry.</p>

<p>Any robots that cause run-time problems with any part of the software, including the
other robots, will be disqualified. Timin's judgement will be final here. In particular,
check every division to ensure that the denominator will never be zero. The same applies
to certain mathematical functions that can have illegal arguments, such as sqrt(). If you
allocate RAM, with &quot;new&quot; or malloc(), be sure to do it only once, even if there
are multiple races. (We can't have you accumulating more RAM with each race!) Also check
for un-initialized variables that can cause seemingly random behaviour.</p>

<p>Points will be awarded as follows for each race:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1st - 10 2nd - 6 3rd - 4 4th - 3 5th - 2 6th - 1</p>

<p>This point system will be used both for deciding the winners of one race meet with
multiple races, and also for accumulating over a period of many months. When there are
multiple races the winning places will be based on the point total for all races. When the
race meet consists of only one race the points will be added to the robot author's
accumulating score. For multiple races, another set of points will be awarded to the best
six robots of the day, and these will be accumulated for the longer term. Hence, for each
race meet, someone will add 10 points to his long term total, someone will add 6 points,
and so on.</p>

<p>Robot code should not make any direct DOS or BIOS calls, nor access memory in any
strange ways. No peripheral hardware may be accessed, with the possible exception of disk
reading during initialization (but see next paragraph). Robots may use the
&quot;extern&quot; keyword to access any data that they can find, but may not alter such
data. Any robot driver function that causes any problems with any other part of the
software will simply not be used. Each robot must use CPU sparingly, so that
race can be run at realistic speed, and no slower. <br>
Race directors's judgement will be final in this matter.
